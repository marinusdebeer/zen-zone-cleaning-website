I was not the first hand person to experience the results, but it was commented how clean the space was. What I do know first hand is that the customer service and communication and payment was second to none. Every message was responded to almost immediately, no wondering on my part. From start to finish, I am very, very happy and will continue to use this company for future needs for sure. Thank you very much.",
